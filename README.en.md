Welcome to **MagikIA**, a personal project built with great dedication to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. The main idea is to create a simple but functional interface that allows you to **filter magical cards** based on **category** and **maximum price** — all interactively and dynamically.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Filter by **category** (Common, Rare, Epic)  
- ✅ Filter by **maximum price** (e.g., $1000)  
- ✅ Responsive layout for different screen sizes  
- ✅ Dynamic navigation without reloading the page  
- ✅ **WhatsApp integration** to buy the card directly via link

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript**
